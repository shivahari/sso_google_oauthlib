# Google Login with Flask app
A flask app to simplify **Google** SSO using [oauthlib](https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib) module.
<br>
The steps in the Flask app are structured based on what I think will help any one implemeting Google login with oauthlib with `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET` & `redirect_uri` generated from the **Google** developer console.
